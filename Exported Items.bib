The current study compared the impact of adolescents’ daytime, pre-bedtime, and post-bedtime smartphone use on their sleep quality. In addition, it explored the differential effects of lean-back and lean-forward smartphone apps. We collected data from 155 adolescents across 21 days using smartphone tracking (745,706 app activities) in combination with experience sampling (1,950 sleep quality assessments). We found no significant effects of daytime and pre-bedtime smartphone use on sleep quality, but a negative association of post-bedtime smartphone use with sleep quality (β = −.09). The association between smartphone use and sleep quality varied across app categories: Time spent on lean-forward apps around bedtime, such as social media apps right before (β = −.08) and game apps after bedtime (β = −.23), was associated with lower sleep quality. The use of lean-back apps (i.e., video players) was not associated with sleep quality, neither before nor after bedtime.},

              Objective
              Previous research linked problematic mobile social media use to non‐suicidal self‐injury (NSSI). However, little research explored the underlying mechanism. Drawing on the social displacement hypothesis, which suggests that excessive social media use may disrupt offline social interactions, leading to negative emotional experiences, the study employs a longitudinal design to explore the relationship between problematic mobile social media use and NSSI, with a specific emphasis on the mediating role of self‐disgust.
            
            
              Methods
              
                A total of 1,684 Chinese adolescents (52.3\% females;
                M
                
                  age
                
                 = 14.59 years, SD
                
                  age
                
                 = 1.27) completed self‐report questionnaires regarding problematic mobile social media use, self‐disgust, and NSSI. The assessment was conducted in three waves, 6 months apart.
              
            
            
              Results
              Using latent growth curve and structural equation modeling, our study observed a consistent linear decline in NSSI levels over time. Higher initial NSSI levels correlated with a slower reduction. Problematic mobile social media use positively influenced the initial level of NSSI. Additionally, self‐disgust played a mediating role in the relationship between problematic mobile social media use and NSSI.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The study underscores the importance of understanding the emotional experiences behind social media use, beyond mere usage duration. By revealing the mediating role of self‐disgust, it provides new insights into the complex interplay between problematic mobile social media use and adolescent NSSI.},

              Background
              Youth use different forms of screen time (e.g., streaming, gaming) that may be related to body mass index (BMI). Screen time is non-independent from other behaviors, including physical activity and sleep duration. Statistical approaches such as isotemporal substitution or compositional data analysis (CoDA) can model associations between these non-independent behaviors and health outcomes. Few studies have examined different types of screen time, physical activity, and sleep duration simultaneously in relation to BMI.
            
            
              Methods
              
                Data were baseline (2017–2018) and one-year follow-up (2018–2019) from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study, a multi-site study of a nationally representative sample of U.S. youth (
                N
                 = 10,544, mean [SE] baseline age = 9.9 [0.03] years, 48.9\% female, 45.4\% non-White). Participants reported daily minutes of screen time (streaming, gaming, socializing), physical activity, and sleep. Sex-stratified models estimated the association between baseline behaviors and follow-up BMI
                z
                -score, controlling for demographic characteristics, internalizing symptoms, and BMI
                z
                -score at baseline.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                In females, isotemporal substitution models estimated that replacing 30 min of socializing (β [95\% CI] = -0.03 [-0.05, -0.002]), streaming (-0.03 [-0.05, -0.01]), or gaming (-0.03 [-0.06, -0.01]) with 30 min of physical activity was associated with a lower follow-up BMI
                z
                -score. In males, replacing 30 min of socializing (-0.03 [-0.05, -0.01]), streaming (-0.02 [-0.03, -0.01]), or gaming (-0.02 [-0.03, -0.01]) with 30 min of sleep was associated with a lower follow-up BMI
                z
                -score. In males, replacing 30 min of socializing with 30 min of gaming was associated with a lower follow-up BMI
                z
                -score (-0.01 [-0.03, -0.0001]). CoDA estimated that in males, a greater proportion of time spent in baseline socializing, relative to the remaining behaviors, was associated with a higher follow-up BMI
                z
                -score (0.05 [0.02, 0.08]). In females, no associations between screen time and BMI were observed using CoDA.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              One-year longitudinal associations between screen time and BMI may depend on form of screen time, what behavior it replaces (physical activity or sleep), and participant sex. The alternative statistical approaches yielded somewhat different results. Experimental manipulation of screen time and investigation of biopsychosocial mechanisms underlying the observed sex differences will allow for causal inference and can inform interventions.},

              To determine the association between social media use (SMU) and physical activity (PA) among Canadian adolescents.
            
            
              Methods
              We used data from 12,358 participants in grades 6 to 10 who responded to the Canadian component of the 2017/2018 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey. Social media intensity and problematic SMU were assessed using a 4-point mutually exclusive scale that contained three categories based on intensity (non-active, active, and intense SMU) and one category based on the presence of addiction-like symptoms irrespective of intensity (problematic SMU). PA was assessed for five domains (i.e., school curriculum, organized sport, exercise, outdoor play, and active transport) and dichotomized using the first quartile to represent high PA engagement in each domain. Meeting PA recommendation of 60 min per day of moderate-to-vigorous PA was calculated using the sum of the five domains. Logistic regression models were used to assess the association between SMU and PA, with active SMU used as the reference group for all models.
            
            
              Results
              Non-active SMU was associated with lower odds of meeting the daily PA recommendations and of high engagement in all five domains of PA when compared to active SMU. Intense SMU was associated with higher odds of meeting the daily PA recommendations. Problematic SMU was not associated with meeting daily PA recommendations, but it was significantly associated with lower odds of high PA engagement in the exercise domain.
            
            
              Conclusion
              The findings of this study suggest that non-active SMU was significantly associated with lower PA levels. Problematic SMU was only significantly associated with lower PA levels in the exercise domain. Intense SMU was associated with higher odds of meeting the PA recommendation.

              Méthodes
              
                Nous avons utilisé les données de 12 358 participants de la 6

                 à la 10
                e
                 année qui ont répondu au volet canadien de l’Enquête sur les comportements de santé des jeunes d’âge scolaire de 2017–2018 (HBSC). L’intensité des médias sociaux et leur utilisation problématique ont été évaluées à l’aide d’une échelle à quatre points mutuellement exclusifs contenant trois catégories basées sur l’intensité (utilisation non active, active et intense des médias sociaux) et une catégorie basée sur la présence de symptômes de dépendance indépendamment de l’intensité (utilisation problématique des médias sociaux). L’activité physique a été évaluée pour cinq domaines (c’est-à-dire le programme scolaire, le sport organisé, l’exercice, le jeu en plein air et le transport actif) et dichotomisée en utilisant le premier quartile pour représenter la participation à une activité physique élevée dans chaque domaine. Le respect de la recommandation de 60 min par jour d’activité physique modérée à vigoureuse a été calculé en utilisant la somme des cinq domaines. Des modèles de régression logistique ont été utilisés pour évaluer la relation entre l’utilisation des médias sociaux et l’activité physique, l’utilisation active des médias sociaux étant utilisée comme groupe de référence pour tous les modèles.
              
            
            
              Résultats
              L’utilisation non active des médias sociaux était associée à une probabilité plus faible de respecter les recommandations en matière d’activité physique quotidienne et à une participation élevée dans les cinq domaines de l’activité physique, par rapport à l’utilisation active des médias sociaux. Une utilisation intense des médias sociaux était associée à une probabilité plus élevée de respecter les recommandations en matière d’activité physique quotidienne. Une utilisation problématique des médias sociaux n’était pas associée au respect des recommandations en matière d’activité physique quotidienne, mais elle était fortement associée à une probabilité moindre de participation élevée à une activité physique dans le domaine de l’exercice.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Les résultats de cette étude suggèrent que l’utilisation non active des médias sociaux est fortement associée à des niveaux d’activité physique plus faibles. Une utilisation problématique des médias sociaux n’était fortement associée à des niveaux d’activité physique plus faibles que dans le domaine de l’exercice. Une utilisation intense des médias sociaux était associée à une probabilité plus élevée de respecter la recommandation en matière d’activité physique.},

Drawing from the concept of polymedia and media repertoire, this study paints social media as an integrated environment and introduces the concept of multiplatform mobile connectedness (MMC) as a representation of an individual’s curative social media repertoire, shaped by meanings attributed to each mobile media platform. By examining its relationship with negative well-being, this study contributes to the debate on the displacement or reinforcement hypothesis of mobile media in an integrated environment. Focusing on emerging adulthoods in China, this study reveals that MMC is associated with higher negative well-being through fear of missing out (FoMO) and leisure boredom. This finding offers a new perspective from MMC on the impact of mobile media on well-being.},

This cross-sectional research was conducted using an online survey with 741 voluntary married participants from Saudi Arabia. Upon analysis, the data confirmed that problematic usage of cell phone, Internet, social media, games, and SMS had a positive effect on phubbing. Interestingly, it showed that both the sample’s and their partner’s relationship satisfaction increased in line with phubbing behavior.

	abstract = {Adolescents’ excessive electronic device use is associated with psychological problems. However, it is unknown which psychological symptom, including emotional symptoms and sleep difficulty, correlates with excessive electronic device use most strongly. Besides, according to the social displacement theory, parent–adolescent communication might mediate the relationship between excessive electronic device use and psychological symptoms. Using the Czech national survey Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) data in the years 2006 (n = 4782) and 2014 (n = 5082), we used network analysis to explore the relationship between psychological symptoms and excessive electronic device use. In addition, we conducted a mediation analysis to examine the role of parent–adolescent communication. The results revealed that excessive electronic device use correlated most strongly with adolescents’ irritability or bad temper, and this conclusion was stable in 2006 and 2014. In 2014, parent–adolescent communication mediated the relationship between adolescents’ excessive electronic device use and their psychological symptoms. The findings suggest that as the internet industry grows, it is essential to improve parent–adolescent communication quality to prevent adolescents’ psychological problems caused by excessive electronic device use.},

	abstract = {Background
              To date, the relationship between diverse time use behaviors and depression status among emerging adults have not been disentangled in the literature. Therefore, if and how the time displacement mechanism activates depressive symptoms among emerging adults remains unclear.
            
            
              Methods
              
                To fill this gap in the literature, we employed a network analysis to make estimations. The emerging adult sample (
                N
                = 1,811) was collected by the Guizhou Population Health Cohort Study. Time use behaviors were measured by an adaption of the self-administered International Physical Activity Questionnaire, and depressive symptoms were assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).
              
            
            
              Results
              The results revealed that the time displacement mechanism of emerging adults differed from that of adolescents. Sleep duration was not crowded out by other activities, while the time spent on computer use was found to be negatively related to time spent on heavy work activities. Moreover, computer use behavior triggered three depressive symptoms (“Anhedonia,” “Guilt,” and “Motor”), but inhibited “Suicide.” The results of the directed acyclic graph revealed that females and heavy drinkers were at risk of depression.
            
            
              Limitations
              The study sample was confined to only one province, which may limit its generalizability. The cross-sectional design impeded the ability to draw causal inferences.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Our results enhance the current understanding of the internal mechanism of how time use behaviors influence depressive symptoms among emerging adults.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              Connectedness to family and peers is a key determinant of adolescent mental health. Existing research examining associations between social media use and social connectedness has been largely quantitative and has focused primarily on loneliness, or on specific aspects of peer relationships. In this qualitative study we use the displacement hypothesis and the stimulation hypothesis as competing theoretical lenses through which we examine the complex relationship between social media use and feelings of connectedness to family and peers.
            
            
              Methods
              In-depth paired and individual interviews were conducted with twenty-four 13–14-year-olds in two inner-city English secondary schools. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, coded and thematically analysed.
            
            
              Results
              Analysis identified four themes: (i) ‘Displacement of face-to-face socialising’ (ii) ‘Social obligations’ (iii) ‘(Mis)Trust’ and (iv) ‘Personal and group identity’. Results indicated stronger support for the stimulation hypothesis than the displacement hypothesis. We found evidence of a complex set of reciprocal and circular relationships between social media use and connectedness consistent with a ‘rich-get-richer’ and a ‘poor-get-poorer’ effect for family and peer connectedness – and a ‘poor-get-richer’ effect in peer connectedness for those who find face-to-face interactions difficult.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Our findings suggest that parents should take a measured approach to social media use, providing clear guidance, promoting trust and responsible time management, and acknowledging the role of social media in making connections. Understanding and sharing in online experiences is likely to promote social connectedness. Supporting young people to negotiate breathing space in online interactions and prioritising trust over availability in peer relationships may optimise the role of social media in promoting peer connectedness.},

	abstract = {This study is aimed to examine the impact of WeChat use intensity on social isolation, loneliness, and well-being during the lockdown period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing on the regulatory loop model of loneliness, the notions of Internet Paradox, the Time Displacement hypothesis and previous literature on WeChat use intensity, we propose that lockdown loneliness (partially) mediates the relationship between lockdown WeChat use intensity and well-being (i.e., lockdown stress and lockdown life satisfaction). Moreover, we assume that lockdown WeChat use intensity moderates the relationship between lockdown social isolation and well-being (i.e., lockdown stress and lockdown life satisfaction) in both a direct and in an indirect way, that is through lockdown loneliness. The results from our Structural Equation Modeling analyses, using a sample of 1,805 Chinese respondents, indicate that all of our research hypotheses are confirmed. From this empirical work, it becomes clear that online social interactions, which are believed by many people to be able to compensate for the lack of offline social interactions during the COVID-19 lockdown period, in fact are endangering their mental health and life satisfaction instead. This article concludes with theoretical and practical implications of our study, followed by its limitations and recommendations for future research.},

In accord with the “augmentation hypothesis,” high levels of interpersonal contact and traditional mass media usage covaried with high Internet use for the highly engaged type, that had highest political participation and life satisfaction, political knowledge, low depressive symptoms and also high anxiety. The other two types fit the “displacement hypothesis,” where Internet-based media displaces traditional media and face-to-face communication. Compared with the digitally immersed, the traditional repertoire was more knowledgeable and politically engaged, and had better well-being. Latent transition analysis showed these repertoires were stable over 6 months.

	abstract = {Background
              COVID-19 has spread like wildfire across the globe, prompting many governments to impose unprecedented stay-at-home orders to limit its transmission. During an extended stay-at-home period, individuals may engage in more online leisure activities. Internet use is a double-edged sword that may have both desirable and undesirable effects on psychological well-being, and this study sought to disentangle adaptive from maladaptive internet use amidst this unusual health crisis.
            
            
              Objective
              The objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence of probable depression during the COVID-19 stay-at-home period and to test three hypothesized risk reduction or risk elevation mechanisms, namely social capital–accrual, escape-from-self, and time-displacement effects.
            
            
              Methods
              This study took place from March to May 2020 at the early stage of the pandemic. The study adopted a prospective design, with an online survey administered to 573 UK and 474 US adult residents at two assessment points 2 months apart.
            
            
              Results
              The prevalence of moderate to severe depression was 36\% (bootstrap bias-corrected and accelerated [BCa] 95\% CI 33\%-39\%) at Time 1 (ie, initial time point) and 27\% (bootstrap BCa 95\% CI 25\%-30\%) at Time 2 (ie, follow-up time point). The results supported the social capital–accrual hypothesis by showing that the approach coping style was inversely associated with Time 2 depression through its positive associations with both social networking and perceived family support. The results also supported the escape-from-self hypothesis by revealing that the avoidant coping style was positively associated with Time 2 depression through its positive associations with both gaming and cyberbullying victimization, but the serial mediation model was no longer significant after Time 1 depression and some demographic risk factors had been controlled for. Finally, the results supported the time-displacement hypothesis by showing that gaming was positively associated with Time 2 depression through its inverse associations with social networking and perceived family support.
            
            
              Conclusions
              During the extended stay-at-home period in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of probable depression during the 2-month study period was high among the UK and US residents. Individuals with distinct coping styles may engage in different types of online leisure activities and perceive varying levels of social support, which are associated with risks of probable depression.},

              Background
              Screen media is among the most common recreational activities engaged in by children. The displacement hypothesis predicts that increased time spent on screen media activity (SMA) may be at the expense of engagement with other recreational activities, such as sport, music, and art. This study examined associations between non-educational SMA and recreational activity endorsement in 9–10-year-olds, when accounting for other individual (i.e., cognition, psychopathology), interpersonal (i.e., social environment), and sociodemographic characteristics.
            
            
              Methods
              Participants were 9254 youth from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study®. Latent factors reflecting SMA, cognition, psychopathology, and social environment were entered as independent variables into logistic mixed models. Sociodemographic covariates included age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, and household income. Outcome variables included any recreational activity endorsement (of 19 assessed), and specific sport (swimming, soccer, baseball) and hobby (music, art) endorsements.
            
            
              Results
              
                In unadjusted groupwise comparisons, youth who spent more time engaging with SMA were less likely to engage with other recreational activities (
                p
                s {\textless} .001). However, when variance in cognition, psychopathology, social environment, and sociodemographic covariates were accounted for, most forms of SMA were no longer significantly associated with recreational activity engagement (

                 {\textgreater} .05). Some marginal effects were observed: for every one SD increase in time spent on games and movies over more social forms of media, youth were at lower odds of engaging in recreational activities (adjusted odds ratio = 0·83, 95\% CI 0·76–0·89). Likewise, greater general SMA was associated with lower odds of endorsing group-based sports, including soccer (0·93, 0·88–0·98) and baseball (0·92, 0·86–0·98). Model fit comparisons indicated that sociodemographic characteristics, particularly socio-economic status, explained more variance in rates of recreational activity engagement than SMA and other latent factors. Notably, youth from higher socio-economic families were up to 5·63 (3·83–8·29) times more likely to engage in recreational activities than youth from lower socio-economic backgrounds.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              Results did not suggest that SMA largely displaces engagement in other recreational activities among 9–10-year-olds. Instead, socio-economic factors greatly contribute to rates of engagement. These findings are important considering recent shifts in time spent on SMA in childhood.},

	abstract = {There has been concern about the effects of high levels of internet use on the mental well-being of young people. This has generally been phrased in terms of a displacement hypothesis, that the extent of internet use and mental well-being are directly proportional. This linear model has been contrasted with a Goldilocks Hypothesis, proposed by Przybylski and Weinstein. This supposes that moderate levels of internet use may be the least harmful, conforming to a curvilinear relationship. Here these hypotheses were tested on a sample of 1140 adolescents (42\% boys, 58\% girls) aged 12–18 years, in 12 schools from Southern Thailand. We first report levels of internet use, and of cybervictimization, taken as one important aspect of mental well-being. We then assess the relationship of four factors of internet use (frequency, time spent, number of places accessed, number of activities) with (a) being a victim of cyberbullying, and (b) being a frequent victim; taking these as indicators of mental well-being. For (a) there was limited evidence of a Goldilocks effect on two out of four measures. For (b) the evidence did support a Goldilocks effect for all four measures, but these were under-powered analyses and the findings did not reach statistical significance. If substantiated on larger samples, a curvilinear relationship between aspects of internet use and cyberbullying would suggest a ‘safe zone’ for adolescent internet use, bringing its benefits while minimizing risks of cyberbullying. In the future, similar research should use larger sample sizes or longitudinal measures when exploring nonlinear trends and include other aspects of mental well-being.},

College-bound high school seniors in 2016 (vs. the late 1980s) spent an hour less a day engaging in in-person social interaction, despite declines in paid work and little change in homework or extracurricular activity time. The results suggest that time displacement occurs at the cohort level, with in-person social interaction declining as digital media use increased, but not at the individual level, where in-person social interaction and social media use are positively correlated. Adolescents’ feelings of loneliness increased sharply after 2011. Adolescents low in in-person social interaction and high in social media use reported the most loneliness.},

Participants completed a daily diary measuring how they spent time each day, affective well-being, and quality of day for 28 days. The results indicate that abstinence from social media increased time spent engaged in seven activities, primarily browsing the Internet, working, childcare, and cooking/cleaning. In addition, associations among psychosocial outcomes and the displaced activities were examined. Time spent working, sleeping, and cooking/cleaning were negatively associated with affective well-being and quality of day. On days participants used social media, minutes of use were negatively associated with quality of day. The results suggest that social media primarily displaces unpleasant or neutral activities.},

              Background:
              This paper determines longitudinal changes in the time Spanish adolescents devote to moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and screen media activity (SMA). Moreover, it examines the displacement hypothesis between time spent on SMA and MVPA.
            
            
              Methods:
              A cohort of 755 adolescents participated in a prospective cohort study over a three‐year period. Repeated measures ANOVA to highlight interaction effects among all variables and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) techniques were employed.
            
            
              Results:
              Age and gender‐related variations in longitudinal changes in time spent on MVPA and SMA evolved in the inverse direction (decreased on MVPA/increased on SMA) according to the ANOVA. The potential displacement between time spent on SMA and MVPA from Wave I to Wave II was analysed via SEM. The first model, estimated in the overall sample, showed no evidence for the displacement hypothesis. Subsequently, a multigroup sequence of panel models was performed and a partial displacement was observed only in boys. Hence, boys who spent more time on SMA were more likely to devote less time to MVPA three years later.
            
            
              Conclusion:
              This study confirms the opposite trend on the time spent on MVPA and SMA over a three‐year period, being clearly higher in SMA. Further SEM analyses reveal a deferred displacement hypothesis between SMA and MVPA only in boys. This partial gendered displacement may be linked to the different uses adolescents make of screen media. The incursion of new technological devices (smartphones or tablets) and their wide range of possibilities for social networking or gaming could explain this displacement},

            This study argues that going to bed may not be synonymous with going to sleep, and that this fragmentation of bedtime results in a two‐step sleep displacement. We separated bedtime (i.e. going to bed) from shuteye time (i.e. attempting to go to sleep once in bed) and assessed the prevalence of electronic media use in both time slots. A convenience sample of 338 adults (aged 18–25 years, 67.6\% women) participated in an online survey. Results indicated a gap of 39 min between bedtime and shuteye time, referred to as ‘shuteye latency’. Respondents with a shuteye latency of, respectively, ≤30 min, ≤1 or {\textgreater}1 h, were 3.3, 6.1 and 9.3 times more likely to be rated as poor sleepers compared to those who went to sleep immediately after going to bed. Before bedtime, volume of electronic media use (17 h 55 min per week) was higher than non‐media activities (14 h per week), whereas the opposite was true after bedtime (media = 3 h 41 min, non‐media = 7 h 46 min). Shuteye latency was related exclusively to prebedtime media use. Findings confirmed the proposed fragmentation of bedtime. Sleep displacement should therefore be redefined as a two‐step process, as respondents not only engage in the delay of bedtime, but also in the delay of shuteye time once in bed. Theoretical, methodological and practical implications are discussed.},

	abstract = {We derive hypotheses from popular accounts of how use of social media affects our strong ties. Several authors have suggested that social media use erodes our strong ties by increasing the volume of social interactions and decreasing their depth. Using two-wave panel data representative of the Dutch population between 15 and 45 years, we examine changes in the core discussion networks (CDNs) of 5312 respondents (with 10,896 relations). Contradicting an erosion of strong ties, we found positive effects of social media use on CDN size, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Social media use was positively related to talking to CDN members in our cross-sectional model. Finally, we found that the CDNs of frequent social media users were more dynamic than those of less frequent users: they are more likely to both lose old and gain new ties. This suggests that Internet use is associated with more, and more dynamic, social interaction.},

Since 2010, iGen adolescents have spent more time on new media screen activities and less time on nonscreen activities, which may account for the increases in depression and suicide.

In addition, offline time spent on social activities, activities with other people, reading books and newspapers and offline hobbies consistently declined. TV viewing increased among the time-rich, fuelling overall screen time. Time spent on outdoor physical activity, entertainment, culture, and voluntary work appear unaffected.

A random sample of 821 adults participated in face-to-face interviews using standardized questionnaires. Lower self-control was associated with more bedtime procrastination. This relationship was mediated by habitual viewing, which led to less bedtime procrastination, and deficient TV self-regulation, which led to more bedtime procrastination. Evening viewing volume was not a significant mediator. Our results support the idea that (1) self-regulatory failure over television viewing can partly explain the common struggle with bedtime, and (2) strong viewing habits seem to inhibit bedtime procrastination.},

Overall, the evidence indicated that moderate use of digital technology is not intrinsically harmful and may be advantageous in a connected world. The findings inform recommendations for limiting adolescents’ technology use and provide a template for conducting rigorous investigations into the relations between digital technology and children’s and adolescents’ health.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to identify prominent patterns of media use across six media (e.g. television, social media, public libraries) and four gratification contexts (e.g. studying, leisure activities), and second, to investigate whether media use patterns vary with six individual characteristics by introducing the construct of information repertoire.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              Data were collected through an online questionnaire completed by 811 adult internet users in the USA. Latent class analysis (LCA), including latent class regression, was performed to analyse the data.
            
            
              Findings
              The study found eight information repertoire profiles. The user characteristics associated with each profile, such as age, race and ethnicity, were identified. The profile with the most respondents was characterised by heavy use of TV and the internet for everyday leisure activities. Overall, the eight profiles do not show exclusive use of one or two media (such as a power-law pattern). However, the profiles do exhibit patterned behaviour, in which respondents use the same configuration of media in two or more gratification contexts. These findings suggest some level of gratification-based heuristic in media selection and use when respondents face contexts they deem to be similar.
            
            
              Originality/value
              In conceptual development, the study introduced the construct of information repertoire to capture media use profiles that account for multiple media use across multiple contexts. Methodologically, less-used LCA was applied, which allowed combining the 24 variables (6 media×4 gratification contexts) and the six demographic covariates in a single, unified analysis.},

              Aim
              Technology use by adolescents close to bedtime commonly leads to sleep problems, and individual factors predicting those at heightened risk are under studied. We investigated whether risk‐taking perceptions influenced length of adolescent technology use at bedtime and whether being aware of time moderated this association.
            
            
              Methods
              We recruited 16 males and five females, with a mean age of 17.6 years, from school and university populations to assess adolescent technology use and bedtimes. They were assessed for trait risk‐taking using the Cognitive Appraisal of Risky Events questionnaire and had unrestrained access to a video game on two separate nights, counterbalanced for clock present or clock absent conditions. The adolescents’ self‐selected bedtime provided a measure of the level of technology use and was the dependent variable.
            
            
              Results
              Adolescents who perceived fewer negative consequences of risky activities on the Cognitive Appraisal of Risky Events played the video game longer and went to bed later than those who perceived more negative consequences (p = 0.03). There was no influence on bedtimes from perceived benefits of risk‐taking or clock presence.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Adolescents who perceived fewer negative consequences of risk‐taking were more likely to stay up later using technology, facing a heightened risk of displaced sleep.},

            Methods. Data came from the youth panel (n = 4899) of Understanding Society, the UK Household Longitudinal Study, conducted in 2009. Well-being was measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and markers of happiness in different life domains.
            Results. The majority of young people used multiple types of SBM for at least 1 hour per day; only 30\% participated in sports every day. Overall, young people with heavy SBM use were less happy than moderate users and more likely to have socioemotional difficulties. Chatting on social networking Web sites and game console use were associated with higher odds of socioemotional problems. Higher total SBM use was associated with lower odds of happiness and higher odds of socioemotional difficulties. Greater participation in sports was associated with higher odds of happiness and lower odds of socioemotional difficulties.
            Conclusions. Further longitudinal research could inform future interventions to reduce sedentary behavior and encourage healthy lifestyles among young people.},

              The present study investigated adolescent video‐game use prior to bedtime and subsequent sleep, working memory and sustained attention performance. Participants were 21 healthy, good‐sleeping adolescents (16 male) aged between 15 and 20 years (
              M
               = 17.6 years, SD = 1.8). Time spent video‐gaming and subsequent sleep was measured across one night in the sleep laboratory. There were significant correlations between time spent video‐gaming and sleep and between video‐gaming and sustained attention, but not working memory. Sleep duration, in turn, had a significant negative association with sustained attention performance. Mediation analyses revealed that the relationship between video‐gaming and sustained attention was fully mediated by sleep duration. These results indicate that video‐gaming affected the ability to sustain attention only in as much as it affected sleep. In order to minimise negative consequences of video‐game playing, video‐games should be used in moderation, avoiding use close to the sleep period, to obviate detriments to sleep and performance.},

              The increasing popularity of Facebook among adolescents has stimulated research to investigate the relationship between Facebook use and loneliness, which is particularly prevalent in adolescence. The aim of the present study was to improve our understanding of the relationship between Facebook use and loneliness. Specifically, we examined how Facebook motives and two relationship‐specific forms of adolescent loneliness are associated longitudinally. Cross‐lagged analysis based on data from 256 adolescents (64\% girls,
              M
              age
              = 15.88 years) revealed that peer‐related loneliness was related over time to using Facebook for social skills compensation, reducing feelings of loneliness, and having interpersonal contact. Facebook use for making new friends reduced peer‐related loneliness over time, whereas Facebook use for social skills compensation increased peer‐related loneliness over time. Hence, depending on adolescents' Facebook motives, either the displacement or the stimulation hypothesis is supported. Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.},
